```

Dyn is a nice DNS service. It's an alternative to Amazon's Route 53. Though I do not believe that dyn's API is as robust as amazone, with the right set of tools is just dandy.

This tool allows for the manipulation of DNS records via the restful API.

It currently supports the following:
* Create A and CNAME records
* Update A and CNAME records
* Delete A and CNAME records
* List all of the records as a CSV

### Requirements
The requests & argparse packages are required but not currently part of the standard library. Get them with pip: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can pass your username and password directly into the script, but it's better if you setup a few environment variables. dyncli will take advantage of the following environment variables if they are present:
```
DYN_USER
DYN_PW
DYN_ZONE
DYN_ACCOUNT
```

You can activate these by appending them to your ```~/.bash_profile```:
```
export DYN_USER='foo'
export DYN_PW='bar'
export DYN_ZONE='example.com'
export DYN_ACCOUNT='example'
```

### Creating a record
Right now both A and CNAME record creation is supported. Create a record uses the ```-c``` flag along with the optional ```--cname``` flag if that's your desired record type.

The default record type is an address (A) record.
```
# Create an A record with default TTL
$ ./dyncli -c myfqdn.example.net -v 10.0.0.100

# Create an A record with custom TTL
$ ./dyncli -c myfqdn.example.net -v 10.0.0.100 --ttl 3600

# Create a CNAME record
$ ./dyncli -c myfqdn.example.net -v otherfqdn.example.net --cname
```

### Updating a record
Once records are created, they can be easily updated with the ```-u``` or ```--update``` flag.

```
# Update the TTL of an existing record
$ ./dyncli -u myfqdn.example.net --ttl 3600

# Update the value of an existing cname record
$ ./dyncli -u myfqdn.example.net -v someotherfqdn.example.net
```

## Deleting a record
Records are deleted by passing the ```-d``` or ```--delete``` flag.
```
# Delete an address (A) record
$ ./dyncli -d myfqdn.example.net

# Delete a cname record (requires the --cname flag)
$ ./dyncli -d myfqdn.example.net --cname
```

### List all records (csv format)
Sometimes it's useful to list all of the records. We use this to do a simple nightly backup of our DNS zone.

The output format is a simple CSV file. Beware that if you have commas in your TXT record, they'll be translated to a pipe (```|```).
```
$ ./dyncli --list
zone,ttl,fqdn,record_type,data
example.net,300,test.example.net,CNAME,test2.example.net
example.net,300,foo.example.net,A,172,16.0.100
example.net,3600,example.net,TXT,public_key=sdjflksdj
..
```

Sometimes it's also useful to check if a zone exists before you go creating one willy nilly
```
$ ./dyncli --list | grep database
example.net,300,database.example.net,A,172.16.0.100
example.net,300,database.internal.example.net,A,172.16.0.100
example.net,300,database.something.example.net,A,172.16.0.100

(See what happens when you go on creating records without checking first?)
```
